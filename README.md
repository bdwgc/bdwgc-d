D library for interfacing with libgc (bdwgc) using [`importC`](https://dlang.org/spec/importc.html)

#### What's the difference between [libgc-d](https://github.com/lycus/libgc-d)?

**A:** **bdwgc-d** is generated by `importC`, not manual binding wrapper.

### Required

- [dmd/ldc](https://dlang.org/download)

> [!WARNING]
> GDC/GNU D does not directly compile C files into modules.

### How to use

```console
dub add bdwgc-d
```

### Compiler Support

`bdwgc-d` should be compatible with multiple D compilers including `ldc2`, and `dmd`. When you use `dub` to build your project, it should automatically detect the compiler you have installed and use it to compile your code.

#### Acknowledge for reference
